Splinter Tutorial
+++++++++++++++++

Before starting, make sure Splinter is :doc:`installed </install>`

This tutorial provides a simple example, teaching step by step how to:

* search for ``splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications'`` in google.com, and
* find if splinter official website is listed among the search results

Create a Browser instance
=========================

First of all, import ``Browser`` class and instantiate it.

.. highlight:: python

::

    from splinter import Browser
    browser = Browser()

**Note:** if you don't provide any driver to ``Browser`` function, ``firefox`` will be used.


Visit Google website
====================

Visit any website using the ``browser.visit`` method. Let's go to Google search page:

.. highlight:: python

::

    browser.visit('http://google.com')


Input search text
=================

After a page is loaded, you can perform actions, such as clicking, filling text input, checking radio and checkbox. Let's fill Google's search field with ``splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications``:

.. highlight:: python

::

    browser.fill('q', 'splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications')

Press the search button
=======================

Tell Splinter which button should be pressed. A button - or any other element - can be identified using its css, xpath, id, tag or name.

In order to find Google's search button, do:

.. highlight:: python

::

    button = browser.find_by_name('btnG')

Note that this ``btnG`` was found looking at Google's page source code.

With the button in hands, we can then press it:

.. highlight:: python

::

    button.click()


Note: Both steps presented above could be joined in a single line, such as:

.. highlight:: python

::

    browser.find_by_name('btnG').click()


Find out that Splinter official website is in the search results
================================================================

After pressing the button, you can check if Splinter official website is among the search responses. This can be done like this:

.. highlight:: python

::

    if browser.is_text_present('splinter.readthedocs.io'):
        print "Yes, found it! :)"
    else:
        print "No, didn't find it :("


In this case, we are just printing something. You might use assertions, if you're writing tests.

Close the browser
=================

When you've finished testing, close your browser using ``browser.quit``:

.. highlight:: python

::

    browser.quit()

All together
============

Finally, the source code will be:

.. highlight:: python

::

    from splinter import Browser

    browser = Browser()
    browser.visit('http://google.com')
    browser.fill('q', 'splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications')
    browser.find_by_name('btnG').click()

    if browser.is_text_present('splinter.readthedocs.io'):
        print "Yes, the official website was found!"
    else:
        print "No, it wasn't found... We need to improve our SEO techniques"

    browser.quit()
