Splinter
==============

Splinter is an open source tool for testing web applications using Python.
It lets you automate browser actions, such as visiting URLs and interacting with their items.

Sample code
-----------

.. highlight:: python

::

    from splinter import Browser

    with Browser() as browser:
        # Visit URL
        url = "http://www.google.com"
        browser.visit(url)
        browser.fill('q', 'splinter - python acceptance testing for web applications')
        # Find and click the 'search' button
        button = browser.find_by_name('btnG')
        # Interact with elements
        button.click()
        if browser.is_text_present('splinter.readthedocs.io'):
            print("Yes, the official website was found!")
        else:
            print("No, it wasn't found... We need to improve our SEO techniques")

**Note:** if you don't provide any driver to ``Browser`` function, ``firefox`` will be used.

Browser based drivers
+++++++++++++++++++++

The following drivers open a browser to run your actions:

* :doc:`Chrome WebDriver </drivers/chrome>`
* :doc:`Firefox WebDriver </drivers/firefox>`
* :doc:`Remote WebDriver </drivers/remote>`

Headless drivers
