What's New in Splinter 0.18.0?
==============================

Added:
* WebDriverElement() now implements the `shadow_root` property. This returns a ShadowRootElement() object to interact with the shadow root of an element.
* Failed driver imports are logged at the debug level instead of silently ignored
* `browser.html_snapshot()` now takes the optional `unique_file` argument. Setting this to False will disable the addition of random characters to the filename.

Changed:
* repr(ElementList()) now returns the repr of the internal container.
* Driver.find_link_by_<x> methods have been removed. Use Driver.links.find_by_<x>.
* Screenshot taken by WebDriverElement.screenshot() now implements Selenium's element screenshot instead of cropping a full page screenshot.
* Flask/Django's back/forward methods more accurately store browsing history
* Official Python 3.6 support has been removed

Fixed:
* 0.17.0 would report as 0.16.0. 0.18.0 reports correctly.
* When using Firefox, extensions can now be installed
