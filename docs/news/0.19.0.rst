[0.19.0]
========

Added
-----

* The methods WebDriverElement.is_visible() and WebDriverElement.is_not_visible() are now available as a replacement for WebDriver.is_element_not_visible_by_css and WebDriver.is_element_visible_by_css.
  See https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html#checking-the-visibility-of-elements for more information.

Changed
-------

* When CookieManager.delete() is called with no arguments then all cookies are deleted. This behaviour has been deprecated. CookieManager.delete_all() should be used instead.
* The message for the error raised when a driver's class is not found has been improved.

Fixed
-----

* FlaskDriver.attach_file() has been fixed.
* urllib3 is now always installed, regardless of driver used.
