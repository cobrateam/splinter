What's New in Splinter 0.18.1?
==============================

Changed:
* Set Firefox preferences through options instead of FirefoxProfile

Fixed:
* Use dedicated logger in browser.py to avoid *clobbering* other Python logging
* Removed required selenium import for error handling, making it possible to use splinter without installing selenium (as long as a selenium driver isn't used)
