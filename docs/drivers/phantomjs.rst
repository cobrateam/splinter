Phantomjs WebDriver
+++++++++++++++++++

.. module:: splinter.driver.webdriver.phantomjs

PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API, to use the driver first you must
`install <http://phantomjs.org/download.html>`_ it in your machine.
The Phantomjs WebDriver is provided by Selenium 2.0, thus you need to install Selenium 2.0 via pip:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ [sudo] pip install selenium

Using Phantomjs WebDriver
-------------------------

To use the Phantomjs driver, all you need to do is pass the string ``phantomjs`` when you create
the ``Browser`` instance:

.. highlight:: python

::

    from splinter import Browser
    browser = Browser('phantomjs')

PhantomJS can also be used from a custom path. To do this you give the path to the PhantomJS executable using the keyword argument ``executable_path`` when creating the ``Browser`` instance:

.. highlight:: python

::

    from splinter import Browser
    browser = Browser('phantomjs', executable_path='path/to/executable')

**Note:** if you don't provide any driver to ``Browser`` function, ``firefox`` will be used.
