.. module:: splinter.driver.flaskclient

To use the ``flask`` driver, you need to install `Flask <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask>`_,
`lxml <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml>`_ and `cssselect <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssselect>`_.
You can install all of them in one step by running:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install splinter[flask]

Using Flask client
------------------

To use the ``flask`` driver, you'll need to pass the string ``flask`` and an app instances via the
``app`` keyword argument when you create the ``Browser`` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from splinter import Browser
    browser = Browser('flask', app=app)

**Note:** if you don't provide any driver to ``Browser`` function, ``firefox`` will be used.

When visiting pages with the Flask client, you only need to provide a path rather than a full URL.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    browser.visit('/my-path')
