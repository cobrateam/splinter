Similar test runners
====================

nose was inspired mainly by py.test_, which is a great test runner, but
formerly was not all that easy to install, and is not based on unittest.

Test suites written for use with nose should work equally well with py.test,
and vice versa, except for the differences in output capture and command line
arguments for the respective tools.
