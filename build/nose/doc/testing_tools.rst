Testing tools
-------------

The nose.tools module provides a number of testing aids that you may
find useful, including decorators for restricting test execution time
and testing for exceptions, and all of the same assertX methods found
in `unittest.TestCase` (only spelled in pep08 fashion, so `assert_equal`
rather than `assertEqual`).
