- Revised configuration system to be less convoluted.
- Added nose.case.TestCase as universal wrapper for all
  testcases. Plugins always see instances of this class.
- Added a management layer to the plugin system, allowing for easy use
  of different plugin loading schemes. The default manager loads
  builtin plugins, 0.10 plugins under the setuptools entrypoint
  nose.plugins.0-10 and provides limited support for legacy plugins
  loaded under the entrypoint nose.plugins.
- Added plugin hooks in all phases of discovery, running and description.

  assert introspection, pdb, and skipped and deprecated test support.
- Added id plugin that allows for easier specification of tests on the
  command line.

  functions that are well-behaved and preserve as much of the original
  function's metadata as possible. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou for the patch.
- Added nose.twistedtools, contributed by Antoine Pitrou. This module adds
  @deferred decorator that makes it simple to write deferred tests, with or
  without timeouts.
- Added monkeypatch to doctests that keeps doctest from stepping on coverage
  when the two plugins are used together. Thanks to David Avraamides for the
  bug report.
- Added isolation plugin. Use this plugin to automatically restore sys.modules
  after each test module or package. Thanks to Michal Kwiatkowski for the
  feature request.
- Fixed bug where -vvvv turned off verbose logging instead of making it even
  more verbose. Thanks to Ian Bicking for the bug report.

  funciton would result in an AttributeError. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou for the
  bug report.
- Updated coverage plugin to ignore lines tagged with #pragma: no cover,
  matching the behavior of coverage.py on the command line. Thanks to Bill
  Zingler for the bug report.
- Added a man page for nosetests. Thanks to Gustavo Noronha Silva for the
  request and providing an example.

0.9.1

- New function nose.runmodule() finds and runs tests only in a
  single module, which defaults to __main__ (like unittest.main() or
  doctest.runmodule()). Thanks Greg Wilson for the suggestion.
- Multiple -w (--where) arguments can now be used in one command line,
  to find and run tests in multiple locations. Thanks Titus Brown for
  the suggestion.
- Multiple --include and --exclude arguments are now accepted in one command
  line. Thanks Michal Kwiatkowski for the feature request.
- Coverage will now include modules not imported by any test when
  using the new --cover-inclusive switch. Thanks James Casbon for the
  patch.
- module:TestClass test selections now properly select all tests in the test
  class.
- startTest and stopTest are now called in plugins at the beginning and end of
  test suites, including test modules, as well as individual tests. Thanks
  Michal Kwiatkowski for the suggestion.
- Fix bug in test selection when run as ``python setup.py test``: 'test' was
  passing through and being used as the test name selection. Thanks Kumar
  McMillan for the bug report.
- Fix bug in handling of -x/--stop option where the test run would stop on
  skipped or deprecated tests. Thanks Kumar McMillan for the bug report.

  report a better error message when a fixture is not callable. Thanks Ian
  Bicking for the bug report.

0.9.0

- More unit tests and better test coverage. Numerous bugfixes deriving from
  same.

  Windows. Add --noexe option so windows users can turn if off.Thanks
  richard at artsalliancemedia dot com for the bug reports.
- Handle a working directory that happens to be in the middle of a package
  more gracefully. Thanks Max Ischenko for the bug report and test case.

  with incorrect names in result output.

0.9.0a2

- In TestLoader, use inspect's isfunction() and ismethod() to filter functions
  and methods, instead of callable(). Thanks to Kumar McMillan for reporting
  the bug.
- Fix doctest plugin: return an empty iterable when no tests are found in a
  directory instead of None. Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report and
  patch.
- Ignore executable python modules, unless run with --exe file. This is a
  partial defense against nose causing trouble by loading python modules that
  are not import-safe. The full defense: don't write modules that aren't
  import safe!
- Catch and warn about errors on plugin load instead of dying.
- Renamed builtin profile module from nose.plugins.profile to
  nose.plugins.prof to avoid shadowing stdlib profile.py module.

  suggestion and patch.
- Add nose.tools package with some helpful test-composition functions and
  decorators, including @raises, contributed by Scot Doyle.

  nose will ensure that all directories from which it imports anything are on
  sys.path before the import.)
- Logging package used for verbose logging.
- Support for skipped and deprecated tests.
- Configuration is no longer global.

0.8.7

- Add support for py.test-style test generators. Thanks to Jay Parlar for
  the suggestion.

  to either become actual infinite loops, or at least take so long to finally
  error out that they might as well be infinite.
- Add -m option to restrict test running to only tests in a particular package
  or module. Like the -f option, -m does not restrict test *loading*, only
  test *execution*.
- When loading and running a test module, ensure that the module's path is in
  sys.path for the duration of the run, not just while importing the module.
- Add id() method to all callable test classes, for greater unittest
  compatibility.

0.8.6

  __file__ attributes
- Added -p (--cover-packages) switch that may be used to restrict coverage
  report to modules in the indicated package(s)

0.8.5

- Output capture and verbose assertion errors now work when run like
  'python setup.py test', as advertised.
- Code coverage improvements: now coverage will be output for all modules
  imported by any means that were not in sys.modules at the start of the test
  run. By default, test modules will be excluded from the coverage report, but
  you can include them with the -t (--cover-tests) option.

0.8.4

- Fix bugs in handling of setup/teardown fixtures that could cause TypeError
  exceptions in fixtures to be silently ignored, or multiple fixtures of the
  same type to run. Thanks to Titus Brown for the bug report.

0.8.3

- Add -V (--version) switch to nosetests
- Fix bug where sys.path would not be set up correctly when running some
  tests, producing spurious import errors (Thanks to Titus Brown and Mike
  Thomson for the bug reports)
- For test classses not derived from unittest.TestCase, output (module.Class)
  "doc string" as test description, when method doc string is available
  (Thanks to David Keeney for the suggestion, even if this isn't quite what he
  meant)

0.8.2

  intelligently, ensuring that the test module we think we are loading is the
  module we actually load, and that modules loaded by other imports are not
  reloaded without cause
- Allow test directories inside of packages. Formerly directories matching
  testMatch but lacking an __init__.py would cause an ImportError when located
  inside of packages

  script when tests fail
- Add missing test files to MANIFEST.in

  activate with --coverage switch or NOSE_COVERAGE environment variable
- More informative error message on import error
- Fix bug where module setup could be called twice and teardown skipped
  for certain setup method names.
- main() returns success value, does not exit. run_exit() added to support
  old behavior; nosetests script now calls nose.run_exit()

0.7.5

- Fix bus error on exit
- Discover tests inside of non-TestCase classes that match testMatch
- Reorganize selftest: now selftest tests the output of a full nose run
- Add test_with_setup.py contributed by Kumar McMillan

- Major rework of output capture and assert introspection
- Improve test discovery: now finds tests in packages
- Replace -n switch ('no cwd') with -w switch ('look here')

  for the suggestion.
- Improvements to selftest

0.5.1
